# Flight Scheduling Analysis Dashboard

A professional aviation analytics platform designed for optimizing flight schedules at busy airports like Mumbai (BOM) and Delhi (DEL). This dashboard offers real-time insights, predictive analytics, and natural language query capabilities tailored for aviation scheduling intelligence.

## Features

- **Live Flight Analytics**: Real-time metrics and flight status updates for Mumbai and Delhi airports.
- **Airport Comparison Dashboard**: Visual comparison of flight scheduling data, congestion, and performance metrics between BOM and DEL.
- **NLP Query Interface**: Natural language processing powered query system allowing intuitive questions about flight data and schedules.
- **Time Slot Optimization**: Analysis of optimal takeoff and landing windows with color-coded recommendations for efficient scheduling.
- **Delay Prediction Models**: Cascading impact analysis to predict delays and recommend scheduling adjustments.
- **Peak Hour Congestion Alerts**: Identification of congestion periods with capacity warnings to avoid bottlenecks.
- **Schedule Optimization Recommendations**: Data-driven insights to enhance on-time performance and efficient airport operations.
- **Responsive Design**: Clean, professional aviation-themed UI with smooth animations and modern UX best practices.

## Design Inspiration

- Aviation control towers and flight tracking dashboards
- Professional aerospace interfaces using blues, whites, and crisp typography
- Data visualization focused on clarity, real-time updates, and effective communication

## Technology Stack

- React and TypeScript for frontend UI components
